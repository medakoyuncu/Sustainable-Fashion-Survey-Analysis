# Clothing Consumption Behaviours and Their Effects on Sustainability

## 📌Project Overview
In an era where the fashion industry is increasingly scrutinized for its environmental impact—ranging from waste generation to resource depletion—sustainable consumption has become a critical topic. This project investigates the clothing shopping habits of university students at Middle East Technical University (METU) to understand the intersection of youth consumption and sustainability awareness.

The study specifically analyzes how sustainability consciousness influences purchasing decisions, such as the preference for fast fashion brands versus second-hand clothing, the frequency of shopping, and post-consumer behaviors like garment disposal and recycling. By examining these factors, the research aims to shed light on whether higher environmental awareness translates into actionable sustainable shopping habits among young adults.

## Data & Methodology
* **Sample:** 303 METU students (collected via random sampling method).
* **Data Collection:** Online and face-to-face surveys consisting of 14 questions (demographics + shopping habits).
* **Analysis Tools:** R 
### Key Statistical Methods Used:
1.  **Ordinal Logistic Regression:** To examine the relationship between years spent in school/age and sustainability preferences.
2.  **Chi-Squared Test:** To test the independence between fast fashion consumption and sustainability awareness.
3.  **Kruskal-Wallis Test:** To compare sustainable clothing preferences across different gender groups and faculties.
4.  **Cramér’s V:** To measure the strength of relationships between categorical variables.

## Key Findings
* **Sustainability & Fast Fashion:** A statistically significant relationship was found between fast fashion consumption frequency and sustainability awareness ($p < 0.05$), though the relationship is weak to moderate.
* **Demographics:** No statistically significant difference was found in sustainable clothing preferences based on **gender** or **faculty**.
* **Education Impact:** The number of years spent at the university did not show a significant correlation with higher sustainability preferences.
* **Second-Hand Habits:** The majority of participants (80.53%) stated they do not buy second-hand clothes.
